# RBIS UK Website

Modern information hub built with **Next.js**, **TypeScript**, and **Tailwind CSS**.

> **Note:** GitHub Pages serves the static `index.html` found at the repository root. It is compiled from TypeScript and styled with Tailwind via CDN so the site remains accessible even without a Next.js build step.

## Getting Started

Install dependencies and run the development server:

```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```

## Production Build

```bash
npm run build
npm start
```

## Technologies

- [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) for framework
- [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) for styling
- [Framer Motion](https://www.framer.com/motion/) for animation
- [three.js](https://threejs.org/) via [react-three-fiber](https://github.com/pmndrs/react-three-fiber) for 3D
